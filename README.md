# Wordlearn - 2016 December
Ionic 1 (AngularJS) hybrid app for vocabulary learning. <br />
That app was my first touch with Vanilla JS, AngularJS and Ionic, so now I can see the code is really bad, but I am posting it anyway :)

I've also made it to work offline. At least after logging in and adding new sets.
Now the WS is down so it ain't working anymore.
